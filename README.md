BBEdit Language Modules

BBEdit, the essential and venerable text editor for macOS, provides mechanisms for adding syntax coloring for additional languages.

So here are my Language Modules which can be added to BBEdit, to give you syntax coloring for some additional languages: PostScript and SFZ. 

PostScript is **the** page description language *par exellence*. 

SFZ is a text format that stores instrument data for computer sound synthesisers. https://sfzformat.com

INSTALLATION
The latest versions of BBEdit reveal the folders for Language Modules (and other features) by selecting the Folders submenu of the BBEdit application menu. 
Just drop the files into that folder. You can also navigate to <user>/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules.


LICENCE

These modules are supplied entirely free, for anyone to use in any way. They are supplied 'as is'.
