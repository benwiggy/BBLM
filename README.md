BBEdit Language Modules

BBEdit, the essential and venerable text editor for macOS, provides mechanisms for adding syntax coloring for additional languages.

So here are my Language Modules which can be added to BBEdit, to give you syntax coloring for some additional languages: PostScript and SFZ. 

PostScript is **the** page description language *par exellence*. 

SFZ is a text format that stores instrument data for computer sound synthesisers. https://sfzformat.com

These modules are supplied entirely free, for anyone to use in any way. They are supplied 'as is'.
